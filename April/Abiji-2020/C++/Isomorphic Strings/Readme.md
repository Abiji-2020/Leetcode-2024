# Intuition
The problem asks to determine if two given strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t` while preserving the order of characters. To solve this problem, we can use two hash maps to store the mappings between characters of `s` and `t`, and vice versa.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two unordered maps `mp` and `revmp` to store the mappings between characters of `s` and `t`, and vice versa.

2. **Mapping Characters**:
   - Iterate through each character `s[i]` and `t[i]` in the strings `s` and `t`.
   - For each character `s[i]`:
     - If `s[i]` is already mapped to a character in `t`, check if the mapped character matches `t[i]`.
     - If not, return `false` as the strings are not isomorphic.
   - For each character `t[i]`:
     - If `t[i]` is already mapped to a character in `s`, check if the mapped character matches `s[i]`.
     - If not, return `false` as the strings are not isomorphic.
   - Update the mappings in `mp` and `revmp`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - If all characters are successfully mapped and matched, return `true` as the strings are isomorphic.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. We iterate through both strings once.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. We use two unordered maps to store the mappings between characters.
