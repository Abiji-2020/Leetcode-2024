# Problem Analysis
Given a string representing parentheses, we need to find the maximum depth of valid parentheses. The depth of a valid parentheses string is the number of parentheses pairs. A valid parentheses string is one that is properly closed and nested.

# Approach
The idea is to traverse the given string character by character:
1. Initialize two variables, `ans` and `prev`, to keep track of the current depth and the maximum depth encountered so far, respectively.
2. Iterate through each character of the string:
   - If the current character is an opening parenthesis `'('`, increment the `ans` variable.
   - If the current character is a closing parenthesis `')'`, decrement the `ans` variable.
   - Update the `prev` variable with the maximum of `ans` and `prev`.
3. Finally, return the value of `prev` as the maximum depth of valid parentheses.

# Method
The method used here is to iterate through the string and maintain a count of opening and closing parentheses. When encountering an opening parenthesis, the count is incremented, and when encountering a closing parenthesis, the count is decremented. The maximum count encountered during the traversal represents the maximum depth of valid parentheses.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We traverse the string only once.
- Space Complexity: O(1). We use only a constant amount of extra space for variables `ans` and `prev`.
