# Problem Analysis
We are given a string `s` containing parentheses. We need to remove the minimum number of parentheses to make the string valid. To make a string valid, each open parenthesis must have a corresponding closing parenthesis, and parentheses must be balanced.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using a two-pass approach:
1. First Pass: Iterate through the string to identify and mark unmatched closing parentheses. We can use a variable `open` to keep track of the number of unmatched open parentheses encountered so far. If we encounter a closing parenthesis and there are no unmatched open parentheses, we mark it for removal by replacing it with a special character, such as '*'.
2. Second Pass: Iterate through the string from right to left. If there are still unmatched open parentheses (`open > 0`) and we encounter an open parenthesis, we mark it for removal by replacing it with '*'.
3. Construct the Result: Construct the resulting string by excluding the marked characters ('*').

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through the string twice.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We use a vector to store the characters of the string.
