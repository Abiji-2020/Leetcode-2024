# Intuition
The goal is to determine the time required to buy `k` tickets from a queue. We'll simulate the process of buying tickets, starting from the first person in the queue and moving in a circular manner until `k` tickets are purchased.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to track the total time required to buy `k` tickets.
2. Initialize a variable `i` to iterate through the queue.
3. While the number of tickets remaining to buy is not zero:
   - If the current person in the queue has tickets available:
     - Increment the `ans` by 1 to account for the time spent buying a ticket.
     - Decrease the number of tickets available for the current person by 1.
   - Move to the next person in the queue by incrementing `i`.
   - If `i` reaches the end of the queue, reset `i` to 0 to continue the circular traversal.
4. Once all `k` tickets are purchased, return the total time `ans`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `tickets` vector.
  - In the worst case, we may need to traverse the entire queue once to buy `k` tickets.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using constant extra space.
