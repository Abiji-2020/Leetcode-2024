# Problem Analysis
We are given a string `s` containing lowercase and uppercase letters. We need to remove adjacent pairs of letters such that the absolute difference between their ASCII values is 32, resulting in a "good" string. We repeat this process until no more such pairs can be removed. Finally, we return the resulting "good" string.

# Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to simulate the removal of adjacent pairs of letters. We iterate through the characters of the input string and perform the following steps:
1. If the stack is not empty and the absolute difference between the current character and the top of the stack is 32, we pop the top of the stack.
2. Otherwise, we push the current character onto the stack.
3. After iterating through all characters, we construct the resulting string by popping characters from the stack and appending them to the front of the result string.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through each character once.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We use a stack to store characters.
