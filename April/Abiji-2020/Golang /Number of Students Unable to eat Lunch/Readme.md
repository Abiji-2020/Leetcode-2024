# Problem Analysis
We are given an array representing students standing in a queue, where each student is represented by 0 or 1. We also have an array representing sandwiches to be served, where each sandwich is also represented by 0 or 1. Students can only eat a sandwich if it matches their preference (0 for the first student in the queue, 1 for the second, and so on). We need to determine the maximum number of students that can eat their preferred sandwiches.

# Approach
1. We iterate through the `students` array and count the number of students who prefer sandwich type 0 and type 1.
2. We then iterate through the `sandwiches` array:
   - If the count of the preferred sandwich type becomes 0, it means there are no more sandwiches of that type left, and the remaining students cannot eat. We return the count of remaining students (the length of `sandwiches` array minus the current index).
   - Otherwise, we decrement the count of the preferred sandwich type.
3. If we complete the iteration without encountering any shortage of sandwiches, it means all students can eat their preferred sandwiches, so we return 0.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the `sandwiches` array. We iterate through the `students` array once to count the preferences and then iterate through the `sandwiches` array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space to store the count of each sandwich type.
