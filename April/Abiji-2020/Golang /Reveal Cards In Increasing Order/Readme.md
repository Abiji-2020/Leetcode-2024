# Intuition
The problem involves revealing cards in a specific order to form an increasing sequence. We need to use a data structure to keep track of the order in which cards are revealed.

# Approach
We can use a deque to simulate the process of revealing cards. Initially, we push indices onto the deque to represent the order in which the cards are revealed. Then, we sort the deck of cards. Next, we iterate through the sorted deck, revealing cards one by one and updating the revealed card's position in the answer array. After revealing each card, we adjust the deque to maintain the correct order for the next iteration.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: Sorting the deck takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of cards. Iterating through the sorted deck and updating the answer array takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
  
- Space complexity: We use additional space for the answer array and the deque. Both of these have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of cards. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
