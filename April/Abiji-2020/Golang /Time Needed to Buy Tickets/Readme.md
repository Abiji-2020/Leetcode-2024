# Intuition
The function aims to calculate the time required to purchase a certain number of tickets (`k`) from a queue. The process simulates buying tickets, starting from the first person in the queue and moving in a circular manner until `k` tickets are purchased.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to keep track of the total time required to buy `k` tickets.
2. Initialize an index variable `i` to iterate through the queue.
3. While there are still tickets to buy (`tickets[k]` is not zero):
   - If the current person in the queue has tickets available (`tickets[i] != 0`):
     - Increment `ans` by 1 to account for the time spent buying a ticket.
     - Decrease the number of available tickets for the current person by 1 (`tickets[i]--`).
   - Move to the next person in the queue by incrementing `i`.
   - If `i` reaches the end of the queue, reset it to 0 to continue the circular traversal.
4. Once all `k` tickets are purchased, return the total time `ans`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `tickets` slice.
  - In the worst case, we may need to traverse the entire queue once to buy `k` tickets.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using only constant extra space.
