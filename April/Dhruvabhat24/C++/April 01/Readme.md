This C++ code defines a method `lengthOfLastWord` that calculates the length of the last word in a given string `s`. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization:** The method initializes an integer variable `n` to store the size of the string `s` and `length` to store the length of the last word, initially set to 0.

2. **Traversing from Right to Left:** The code iterates through the characters of the string from right to left, starting from index `n - 1`.

3. **Calculating Length of Last Word:** During each iteration, the code checks if the current character is a space and if the length of the last word is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, it indicates the end of the last word, and the loop is terminated. If the current character is not a space, it increments the `length` variable to calculate the length of the last word.

4. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire string, the method returns the calculated length of the last word.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have the string: `"Hello World  "`.

- **Initialization:** The size of the string `s` is 12, and the `length` variable is initially set to 0.
- **Traversing from Right to Left:** The code iterates through the string from right to left.
- **Calculating Length of Last Word:** It calculates the length of the last word 'World' as it encounters non-space characters until it encounters a space character.
- **Returning Result:** The method returns the length of the last word, which is 5.

Therefore, the length of the last word in the string `"Hello World  "` is 5.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm calculates the length of the last word in a string and demonstrates its execution with an example.
Let's consider another example to illustrate the `lengthOfLastWord` method:

Suppose we have the string: `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`.

1. **Initialization:** The size of the string `s` is 44, and the `length` variable is initially set to 0.
2. **Traversing from Right to Left:** The code iterates through the string from right to left.
3. **Calculating Length of Last Word:** It calculates the length of the last word 'dog' as it encounters non-space characters until it encounters a space character.
4. **Returning Result:** The method returns the length of the last word, which is 3.

Therefore, the length of the last word in the string `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` is 3.

This example demonstrates how the `lengthOfLastWord` method correctly calculates the length of the last word in a given string.
