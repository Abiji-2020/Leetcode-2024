This C++ code defines a method `isIsomorphic` that determines whether two given strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization:** The method initializes two unordered maps `mp` and `mp2` to store mappings between characters of `s` and `t`. These maps will help in checking the isomorphic relationship between the strings.

2. **Mapping Characters:** The code iterates through the characters of both strings using a loop. For each character at index `i`:
    - It checks if there is a mapping already present for the character `s[i]` in `mp`. If a mapping exists and the mapped character is not equal to `t[i]`, it means the mapping is invalid, and the strings are not isomorphic. Similarly, it checks for the reverse mapping in `mp2`.
    - If no invalid mapping is found, it establishes mappings between `s[i]` and `t[i]` in `mp` and between `t[i]` and `s[i]` in `mp2`.

3. **Returning Result:** If the loop completes without encountering any invalid mappings, it indicates that the strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, and the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have the strings `s = "egg"` and `t = "add"`.

- **Mapping Characters:**
    - For the first character 'e' in `s`, it maps to 'a' in `t`.
    - For the second character 'g' in `s`, it maps to 'd' in `t`.
    - For the third character 'g' in `s`, it maps to 'd' in `t`.
- **Result:** The method returns `true` since the strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic.
