## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: makeGood

#### Parameters:
- `s` (string): Input string.

#### Returns:
- `string`: The modified string after removing adjacent characters with opposite cases.

#### Variables:
- `ans` (string): Variable to store the resulting string after removal.
- `st` (stack<char>): Stack to keep track of characters for processing.

#### Steps:
1. Disable synchronization between C++ input and output streams for faster execution.
2. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the resulting string.
3. Initialize a stack `st` to keep track of characters.
4. Iterate through each character of the input string `s`.
5. If the stack is empty, push the current character onto the stack.
6. If the stack is not empty and the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the top character of the stack and the current character is 32 (indicating they are opposite cases), pop the top character from the stack.
7. Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
8. After processing all characters, pop characters from the stack and concatenate them to the beginning of the `ans` string until the stack becomes empty.
9. Return the modified string `ans`.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "leEeetcode"
- Output: "leetcode"
- Explanation: The resulting string after removing adjacent characters with opposite cases is "leetcode".
