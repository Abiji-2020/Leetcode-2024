## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: minRemoveToMakeValid

#### Parameters:
- `s` (string): Input string containing parentheses.

#### Returns:
- `string`: The modified string after removing parentheses to make it valid.

#### Variables:
- `open` (int): Variable to keep track of the number of open parentheses encountered.
- `close` (int): Variable to keep track of the number of close parentheses encountered.
- `ans` (string): Variable to store the resulting string after removal of extra parentheses.
- `c` (char): Temporary variable to store each character of the string during traversal.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `open` and `close` variables to 0.
2. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the resulting string after removal.
3. Traverse the string `s` from left to right.
4. If the current character `c` is neither '(' nor ')', append it directly to the `ans`.
5. If `c` is '(', increment `open` and append it to `ans`.
6. If `c` is ')' and `open` is greater than 0, decrement `open` and append it to `ans`.
7. After traversing from left to right, if there are still extra open parentheses (`open > 0`), reverse the string and repeat the process to remove extra opening parentheses from the end to the start.
8. Return the resulting string `ans`.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "))(a(b(c)d"
- Output: "(a(bc)d"
- Explanation: The minimum removals to make the string valid are indicated by removing the excess ')' characters.
