## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: countStudents

#### Parameters:
- `students` (vector<int>&): A vector representing the preferences of students, where each element indicates the preference of a student (0 or 1).
- `sandwiches` (vector<int>&): A vector representing the available sandwiches, where each element indicates the type of sandwich available (0 or 1).

#### Returns:
- `int`: The number of students who couldn't get their preferred sandwich.

#### Variables:
- `counts` (vector<int>): A vector to keep track of the count of each type of sandwich preference (0 or 1).
- `remaining` (int): A variable to keep track of the remaining students who couldn't get their preferred sandwich.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a vector `counts` of size 2 with initial values set to 0, to keep track of the count of each type of sandwich preference.
2. Iterate through the `students` vector and count the occurrences of each type of sandwich preference.
3. Initialize an integer variable `remaining` to the size of the `sandwiches` vector, indicating the number of students initially.
4. Iterate through the `sandwiches` vector:
   - If the count of the current sandwich type in `counts` is 0, it means no student has this preference left. Break the loop.
   - If `remaining` becomes 0, indicating all students have been considered, break the loop.
   - Decrement the count of the current sandwich type in `counts`.
   - Decrement the `remaining` variable to indicate that a student has been served.
5. After iterating through all sandwiches, return the value of `remaining`, which indicates the number of students who couldn't get their preferred sandwich.

#### Example:
- Input:
  - students = [1,1,0,0]
  - sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
- Output: 0
- Explanation: Both types of sandwiches are available. All students can get their preferred sandwiches, so the return value is 0.
