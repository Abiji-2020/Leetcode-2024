## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: deckRevealedIncreasing

#### Parameters:
- `deck` (vector<int>&): A vector representing a deck of cards.

#### Returns:
- `vector<int>`: A vector representing the order in which the cards are revealed, following a specific algorithm.

#### Variables:
- `n` (int): An integer representing the size of the deck.
- `st` (deque<int>): A deque data structure used to implement a specific card revealing algorithm.
- `revealed` (vector<int>): A vector to store the revealed cards in the order they are revealed.

#### Steps:
1. Get the size of the deck and store it in the variable `n`.
2. Sort the `deck` vector in ascending order.
3. Create a deque `st` to simulate the revealing process.
4. Push the largest card (last element of the sorted deck) to the front of the deque.
5. Iterate backwards through the sorted deck (from second largest to smallest card):
   - Push the last element of the deque to the front.
   - Pop the last element from the deque.
   - Push the current card from the deck to the front of the deque.
6. Create a vector `revealed` to store the revealed cards.
7. Pop each element from the front of the deque and push it to the `revealed` vector.
8. Return the `revealed` vector containing the order in which the cards are revealed.

#### Example:
- Input: deck = [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
- Output: [2,17,13,11,5,3,7]
- Explanation: After sorting the deck, it becomes [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]. Following the revealing algorithm, the order in which the cards are revealed is [2,17,13,11,5,3,7].
