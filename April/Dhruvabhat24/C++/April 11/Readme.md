## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: removeKdigits

#### Parameters:
- `num` (string): A string representing a non-negative integer number.
- `k` (int): An integer representing the number of digits to remove.

#### Returns:
- `string`: The smallest possible integer after removing `k` digits from `num`.

#### Variables:
- `stk` (vector<char>): A vector to store the digits of the number.
- `ans` (string): A string to store the resulting smallest possible integer after removing `k` digits.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty vector `stk` to store the digits of the number.
2. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the resulting smallest possible integer.
3. Iterate through each character `c` in the string `num`.
4. While `k` is greater than 0, the vector is not empty, and the last element of the vector is greater than the current character `c`:
   - Pop elements from the vector and decrement `k`.
5. Push the current character `c` onto the vector.
6. After the loop, if there are still remaining `k` digits to remove, pop elements from the vector.
7. Iterate through the elements in the vector:
   - If the string `ans` is empty and the current character is '0', skip appending it.
   - Otherwise, append the character to the string `ans`.
8. If the string `ans` is empty, return "0", otherwise return the string `ans`.

#### Example:
- Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
- Output: "1219"
- Explanation: After removing 3 digits, the smallest possible integer is "1219".
