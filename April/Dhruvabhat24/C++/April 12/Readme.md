## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: trap

#### Parameters:
- `h` (vector<int>&): A vector representing the heights of bars.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The total amount of water trapped between the bars.

#### Variables:
- `l` (int): The left pointer for the leftmost bar.
- `r` (int): The right pointer for the rightmost bar.
- `lmax` (int): The maximum height encountered from the left side.
- `rmax` (int): The maximum height encountered from the right side.
- `ans` (int): The total amount of water trapped between the bars.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `l` to 0 (index of the leftmost bar) and `r` to the size of the vector `h` minus 1 (index of the rightmost bar).
2. Initialize `lmax` and `rmax` to the minimum integer value to track the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides respectively.
3. Initialize `ans` to 0 to store the total amount of water trapped.
4. Iterate through the bars using a while loop until `l` is less than `r`.
5. Update `lmax` as the maximum of `lmax` and the height of the bar at index `l`.
6. Update `rmax` as the maximum of `rmax` and the height of the bar at index `r`.
7. Add the difference between the minimum of `lmax` and `rmax` and the height of the current bar to `ans`.
   - If `lmax` is less than `rmax`, increment `l` to move the left pointer to the right.
   - Otherwise, decrement `r` to move the right pointer to the left.
8. After the while loop, return the total amount of water trapped stored in `ans`.

#### Example:
- Input: h = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
- Output: 6
- Explanation: The total amount of water trapped between the bars is 6 units.
