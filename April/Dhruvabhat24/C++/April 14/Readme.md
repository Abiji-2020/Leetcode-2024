## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: sumOfLeftLeaves

#### Parameters:
- `root` (TreeNode*): A pointer to the root of a binary tree.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The sum of the values of all left leaves in the binary tree.

#### Variables:
- `ans` (int): A variable to store the sum of the values of left leaves.

#### Steps:
1. Check if the root node is null. If it is, return 0 as there are no left leaves.
2. Initialize `ans` to 0 to store the sum of the values of left leaves.
3. Check if the left child of the current node exists:
   - If it exists:
     - Check if the left child is a leaf node (i.e., it does not have any left or right children).
       - If it is a leaf node, add its value to `ans`.
       - If it is not a leaf node, recursively call the `sumOfLeftLeaves` function for the left child.
4. Recursively call the `sumOfLeftLeaves` function for the right child of the current node.
5. Return the value of `ans`.

#### Example:
Consider a binary tree:

     3
    / \
    9  20
     /  \
    15   7




- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 24
- Explanation: The sum of the values of all left leaves is 9 + 15 = 24.
