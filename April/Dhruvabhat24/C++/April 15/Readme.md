### Explanation of the Code

This C++ code defines a `Solution` class with a method `sumNumbers` that calculates the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers represented by paths in a binary tree. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with a lambda function for recursion.

1. **`sumNumbers` method**: This is the public method that acts as an interface to calculate the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in the binary tree.

    - It initializes a variable `ans` to store the final sum.

    - It defines a lambda function `dfs` for depth-first search, which takes a `TreeNode*` parameter `node` and an integer `path`.

        - Inside the lambda function:
            - If the `node` is `nullptr`, indicating an empty node, it returns.
            - If the `node` is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children), it calculates the sum of the numbers in the current path (`path * 10 + node->val`) and adds it to `ans`.
            - If the `node` has children, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, updating the `path` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the value of the current node.

    - After defining the lambda function, it calls `dfs` with the root node and an initial `path` of 0.

    - Finally, it returns the accumulated sum `ans`.

3. **Return Value**: The `sumNumbers` method returns the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers represented by paths in the binary tree.

Overall, the code efficiently computes the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree using a depth-first search approach with a lambda function for recursion.
