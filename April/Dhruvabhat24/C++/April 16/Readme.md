### Explanation of the Code

This C++ code defines a `Solution` class with a method `addOneRow` that adds a new row of nodes with a specified value to a binary tree at a specified depth. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach for traversal.

1. **`dfs` method**: This is a helper function that performs a depth-first search traversal of the binary tree.

    - Parameters:
        - `root`: The current root node of the subtree.
        - `val`: The value of the nodes to be added.
        - `depth`: The target depth at which the new row should be added.
        - `level`: The current level of recursion.

    - Inside the function:
        - If the current `root` is `nullptr`, indicating an empty node, it returns.
        - If the current `level` is less than `depth - 1`, it means we haven't reached the level where the new row should be added. In this case, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, incrementing the level.
        - If the current `level` is equal to `depth - 1`, it means we've reached the level where the new row should be added. In this case, it inserts new nodes with the specified value as children of the current root node, preserving the existing structure.

2. **`addOneRow` method**: This is the public method that acts as an interface to add a new row of nodes to the binary tree.

    - If the `depth` is 1, it creates a new node with the specified value and makes the current root node its left child.
    
    - Otherwise, it calls the `dfs` method with the root node, the specified value, and an initial depth of 1.

    - It returns the root of the modified binary tree after adding the new row.

3. **Return Value**: The `addOneRow` method returns the root of the modified binary tree after adding the new row.

Overall, the code efficiently adds a new row of nodes with the specified value to a binary tree at the specified depth using a depth-first search approach.
