### Explanation of the Code

This C++ code defines a `Solution` class with a method `numIslands` that counts the number of islands in a grid of characters ('1' represents land and '0' represents water). It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore and mark connected land cells.

1. **`inside` method**: This method checks whether a given position `(i, j)` is inside the grid boundaries.

2. **`dfs` method**: This is a helper function that performs depth-first search traversal starting from a given position `(i, j)`.

    - If the given position is outside the grid boundaries or corresponds to water ('0'), it returns.
    
    - If the given position corresponds to land ('1'), it marks the cell as visited ('2') and recursively explores its adjacent land cells in all four directions: up, down, left, and right.

3. **`numIslands` method**: This method iterates through each cell of the grid to count the number of islands.

    - It initializes the variables `n` and `m` with the dimensions of the grid.
    
    - It initializes a variable `num` to count the number of islands.
    
    - It iterates through each cell of the grid:
        - If the current cell contains land ('1'), it increments the island count (`num++`) and starts a depth-first search from that cell to mark all connected land cells.
    
    - After iterating through all cells, it returns the total number of islands.

4. **Return Value**: The `numIslands` method returns the number of islands present in the grid.

Overall, the code efficiently counts the number of islands in a grid using a depth-first search approach to explore and mark connected land cells.
