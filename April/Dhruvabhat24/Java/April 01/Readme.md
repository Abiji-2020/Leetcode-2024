This Java code defines a method `lengthOfLastWord` that calculates the length of the last word in a given string `s`. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation and example iterations:

1. **Initialization:** The method initializes an integer variable `i` to the index of the last character in the string `s`.

2. **Traversing Consecutive Spaces:** The code traverses the string from right to left while encountering consecutive spaces. This step ensures that the pointer `i` stops at the end of the last word or the last non-space character.

3. **Finding the Last Word:** After encountering consecutive spaces, the code moves the pointer `i` further to the left until it reaches the start of the last word. This step positions `i` at the last character of the last word.

4. **Calculating Length:** Finally, the method calculates the length of the last word by subtracting the index `i` from the index of the last character of the string (stored in `lastIndex`). This value represents the length of the last word in the string.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have the string: `"Hello World  "`.

- **Initialization:** The pointer `i` is initially set to 10, pointing to the last character 'd'.
- **Traversing Consecutive Spaces:** The pointer `i` moves to the left while encountering consecutive spaces, stopping at index 5.
- **Finding the Last Word:** The pointer `i` continues moving to the left until it reaches the start of the last word 'World', stopping at index 6.
- **Calculating Length:** The length of the last word is calculated as `10 - 6 = 4`, which is the length of the word 'World'.

Therefore, the length of the last word in the string `"Hello World  "` is 4.
