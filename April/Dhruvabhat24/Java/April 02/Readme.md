This Java code defines a method `isIsomorphic` that determines whether two given strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization:** The method initializes a HashMap `m` to store mappings between characters of `s` and `t`. The key-value pair represents the character in `s` (key) and its corresponding character in `t` (value).

2. **Mapping Characters:** The code iterates through the characters of both strings using a loop. For each character at index `i`:
    - It puts the character `s.charAt(i)` as the key and the index `i` as the value in the HashMap `m`. If a mapping already exists for the same key, it returns the previous value associated with the key.
    - Similarly, it puts the concatenation of the character `t.charAt(i)` with an empty string as the key (to convert it into a String) and the index `i` as the value in the HashMap `m`. If a mapping already exists for the same key, it returns the previous value associated with the key.

3. **Checking Isomorphism:** After putting mappings for all characters, it checks if the values returned while putting mappings for `s` and `t` are equal. If they are not equal, it means the mappings are not consistent, and the strings are not isomorphic. In this case, the method returns `false`.

4. **Returning Result:** If the loop completes without encountering any inconsistency in mappings, it indicates that the strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, and the method returns `true`.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have the strings `s = "egg"` and `t = "add"`.

- **Mapping Characters:**
    - For the first character 'e' in `s`, it maps to 'a' in `t`.
    - For the second character 'g' in `s`, it maps to 'd' in `t`.
    - For the third character 'g' in `s`, it maps to 'd' in `t`.
- **Result:** The method returns `true` since the strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic.
