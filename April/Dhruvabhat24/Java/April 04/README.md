## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: maxDepth

#### Parameters:
- `s` (String): Input string containing parentheses.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The maximum depth of nested parentheses in the input string.

#### Variables:
- `count` (int): Variable to keep track of the current nesting level of parentheses.
- `max` (int): Variable to store the maximum nesting level encountered so far.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `count` and `max` to 0.
2. Iterate through each character of the input string `s`.
3. If the character is '(', increment `count` to signify the opening of a new nested level.
4. Update `max` with the maximum of the current `count` and `max`. This keeps track of the maximum nesting level encountered so far.
5. If the character is ')', decrement `count` to signify the closing of a nested level.
6. After iterating through the entire string, return the value of `max` as the maximum depth of nested parentheses.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "(a(b)c)d((e)f)"
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The maximum depth of nested parentheses is 3, as seen in "(a(b)c)d((e)f)".
