## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: minRemoveToMakeValid

#### Parameters:
- `s` (String): Input string containing parentheses.

#### Returns:
- `String`: The modified string after removing parentheses to make it valid.

#### Variables:
- `balance` (int): Variable to keep track of the balance of parentheses encountered while traversing the string.
- `str` (StringBuilder): A mutable sequence of characters, initialized with the input string `s`.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize the `balance` variable to 0 to keep track of the balance of parentheses.
2. Create a `StringBuilder` `str` and initialize it with the input string `s`.
3. Traverse the string from left to right using a for loop.
4. If the current character is '(', increment the `balance` by 1.
5. If the current character is ')':
   - If `balance` is greater than 0, decrement `balance`.
   - Otherwise, delete the current character from the StringBuilder `str`, and adjust the index `i` backward by 1 to recheck the previous character.
6. Traverse the string from right to left using another for loop.
7. If the current character is '(' and `balance` is greater than 0, delete the current character from the StringBuilder `str` and decrement `balance`.
8. After traversing both directions, return the resulting string by converting the StringBuilder `str` to a string using the `toString()` method.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "))(a(b(c)d"
- Output: "(a(bc)d"
- Explanation: The minimum removals to make the string valid are indicated by removing the excess ')' characters.
