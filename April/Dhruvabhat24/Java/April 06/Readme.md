## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: makeGood

#### Parameters:
- `s` (String): Input string.

#### Returns:
- `String`: The modified string after removing adjacent characters with opposite cases.

#### Variables:
- `sb` (StringBuilder): A mutable sequence of characters, initialized with the input string `s`.
- `i` (int): An integer variable used as an index for traversing the string.

#### Steps:
1. Create a `StringBuilder` `sb` and initialize it with the input string `s`.
2. Initialize an integer variable `i` to 0 to start iterating through the characters of the string.
3. Iterate over the string using a while loop until `i` reaches the second to the last character of the string.
4. Within the loop, get the current character at index `i` and the next character at index `i+1`.
5. Check if the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the current character and the next character is 32 (indicating they are opposite cases).
6. If the condition is true, delete the two adjacent characters from the StringBuilder `sb`.
   - Adjust the index `i` backward by 1 if `i` is greater than 0, to recheck the previous character with the potentially changed characters after deletion.
   - This deletion is effectively removing the pair of characters that cancel each other out due to opposite cases.
7. If the condition is false, increment the index `i` to proceed to the next pair of characters.
8. After processing all adjacent pairs of characters, return the resulting string by converting the StringBuilder `sb` to a string using the `toString()` method.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "leEeetcode"
- Output: "leetcode"
- Explanation: The resulting string after removing adjacent characters with opposite cases is "leetcode".
