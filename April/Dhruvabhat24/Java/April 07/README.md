## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: checkValidString

#### Parameters:
- `s` (String): Input string containing characters '(' and/or ')'.

#### Returns:
- `boolean`: Returns true if the string is valid, otherwise false.

#### Variables:
- `leftCount` (int): Variable to keep track of the count of open parentheses '(' encountered so far.
- `rightCount` (int): Variable to keep track of the count of closing parentheses ')' encountered so far.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `leftCount` and `rightCount` variables to 0.
2. Iterate through each character `c` in the input string `s`.
3. If `c` is '(', increment `leftCount` by 1, else decrement it by 1.
4. If `c` is ')', decrement `rightCount` by 1, else increment it by 1.
5. Check if `rightCount` becomes negative at any point. If it does, it indicates that there are more ')' than '(' encountered so far, making the string invalid. In this case, break the loop and return false.
6. Ensure that `leftCount` does not become negative by taking its maximum with 0.
7. After iterating through all characters, check if `leftCount` is 0. If it is, it indicates that there are equal numbers of '(' and ')', and all ')' are matched with a preceding '('. Return true in this case, indicating the string is valid, otherwise return false.

#### Example:
- Input: s = "(*))"
- Output: true
- Explanation: The string can be valid by treating '*' as an open parenthesis, resulting in "((()".
