## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: timeRequiredToBuy

#### Parameters:
- `tickets` (int[]): An array representing the prices of tickets at different positions.
- `k` (int): An integer representing the position at which the person wants to buy the ticket.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The total time required to buy tickets according to the given strategy.

#### Variables:
- `total` (int): An integer variable to store the total time required to buy the tickets.
- `i` (int): An integer variable used as an index in the loop.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize the variable `total` to 0 to store the total time required.
2. Iterate through the `tickets` array using a for loop with the index `i`.
3. For each position `i`:
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, calculate the time required to buy the ticket at position `i` as the minimum of the prices of tickets at positions `i` and `k`.
   - If `i` is greater than `k`, calculate the time required to buy the ticket at position `i` as the minimum of the prices of tickets at positions `i` and `k` minus 1.
4. Add the calculated time to the `total`.
5. After iterating through all positions, return the `total` time required to buy the tickets.

#### Example:
- Input:
  - tickets = [2, 5, 4, 7, 9, 3]
  - k = 3
- Output: 23
- Explanation: 
  - At position 0, the person pays min(2, 7) = 2.
  - At position 1, the person pays min(5, 7) = 5.
  - At position 2, the person pays min(4, 7) = 4.
  - At position 3 (the chosen position), the person pays min(7, 7) = 7.
  - At position 4, the person pays min(9, 7 - 1) = 7.
  - At position 5, the person pays min(3, 7 - 1) = 3.
  - Total time required = 2 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 7 + 3 = 28.
