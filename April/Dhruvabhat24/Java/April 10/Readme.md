## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: deckRevealedIncreasing

#### Parameters:
- `deck` (int[]): An array representing a deck of cards.

#### Returns:
- `int[]`: An array representing the order in which the cards are revealed, following a specific algorithm.

#### Variables:
- `n` (int): An integer representing the size of the deck.
- `st` (Deque<Integer>): A deque data structure used to implement a specific card revealing algorithm.

#### Steps:
1. Get the size of the deck and store it in the variable `n`.
2. Sort the `deck` array in ascending order.
3. Create a deque `st` to simulate the revealing process.
4. Push the largest card (last element of the sorted deck) to the front of the deque.
5. Iterate backwards through the sorted deck (from second largest to smallest card):
   - Remove the last element of the deque and add it to the front.
   - Push the current card from the deck to the front of the deque.
6. Replace the elements of the original `deck` array with the elements from the deque.
7. Return the modified `deck` array containing the order in which the cards are revealed.

#### Example:
- Input: deck = [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
- Output: [2,17,13,11,5,3,7]
- Explanation: After sorting the deck, it becomes [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]. Following the revealing algorithm, the order in which the cards are revealed is [2,17,13,11,5,3,7].
