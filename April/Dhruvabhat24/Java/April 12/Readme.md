## Explanation of the Code:

### Class: Solution

### Method: trap

#### Parameters:
- `height` (int[]): An array representing the heights of bars.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The total amount of water trapped between the bars.

#### Variables:
- `count` (int): A variable to store the total amount of water trapped.
- `th` (int): The height of the current bar.
- `nh` (int): The height of the next bar.
- `lastcount` (int): A variable to store the count before processing the current block of bars.
- `maxEl` (int): A variable to store the maximum height encountered within a block of bars.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `count` to 0 to store the total amount of water trapped.
2. Iterate through the bars using a for loop until the second last bar.
3. Get the height of the current bar (`th`) and the height of the next bar (`nh`).
4. If the height of the next bar is greater than or equal to the height of the current bar, continue to the next iteration.
5. Store the current `count` in `lastcount` before processing the current block of bars.
6. Initialize `maxEl` to 0 to track the maximum height encountered within the current block of bars.
7. Iterate through the bars starting from the next bar until the end of the array.
   - If the height of the current bar is less than the height of the current block of bars, update `maxEl` as the maximum of `maxEl` and the height of the current bar.
   - If the height of the current bar is greater than or equal to the height of the current block of bars:
     - Iterate through the bars within the current block starting from the next bar until the current bar.
       - Calculate the difference in height between the height of the current block of bars and the height of the current bar, and add it to `count`.
     - If `count` is different from `lastcount`, update the current index `i` to the index of the last bar processed within the current block and break the loop.
8. If `count` is the same as `lastcount` after processing the current block of bars:
   - Iterate through the bars starting from the next bar until the end of the array.
     - If the height of the current bar is less than `maxEl`, continue to the next iteration.
     - Iterate through the bars within the current block starting from the next bar until the current bar.
       - Calculate the difference in height between `maxEl` and the height of the current bar, and add it to `count`.
     - If `count` is different from `lastcount`, update the current index `i` to the index of the last bar processed within the current block and break the loop.
9. Return the total amount of water trapped stored in `count`.

#### Example:
- Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
- Output: 6
- Explanation: The total amount of water trapped between the bars is 6 units.
