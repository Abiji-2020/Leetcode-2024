### Explanation of the Code

This Java code defines a `Solution` class with a method `sumNumbers` that calculates the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers represented by paths in a binary tree.

1. **`sumTree` method**: This is a recursive helper method that calculates the sum of root-to-leaf numbers.

    - Parameters:
        - `root`: The current root node of the subtree.
        - `sum`: The sum of the numbers calculated so far in the path from the root to the current node.

    - It first checks if the `root` is `null`. If so, it returns 0, indicating the end of a path.

    - It calculates the sum of the numbers in the current path by multiplying the current sum by 10 and adding the value of the current node (`sum = sum * 10 + root.val`).

    - If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children), it returns the sum of the numbers in the current path.

    - If the current node has children, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, passing the updated sum.

    - It returns the sum of the numbers calculated from both the left and right subtrees.

2. **`sumNumbers` method**: This is the public method that acts as an interface to calculate the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in the binary tree.

    - It simply calls the `sumTree` method with the root node and an initial sum of 0.

    - It returns the final sum calculated by the `sumTree` method.

3. **Return Value**: The `sumNumbers` method returns the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers represented by paths in the binary tree.

Overall, the code efficiently computes the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree using recursion.
