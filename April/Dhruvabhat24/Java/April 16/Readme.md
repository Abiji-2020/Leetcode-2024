### Explanation of the Code

This Java code defines a `Solution` class with a method `addOneRow` that adds a new row of nodes with a specified value to a binary tree at a specified depth.

1. **`helper` method**: This is a recursive helper method that adds a new row of nodes to the binary tree.

    - Parameters:
        - `root`: The current root node of the subtree.
        - `val`: The value of the nodes to be added.
        - `depth`: The target depth at which the new row should be added.
        - `currdepth`: The current depth of the recursion.

    - It first checks if the target depth is 1. If so, it creates a new node with the specified value and makes the current root node its left child. Then, it returns the new node.
    
    - If the `root` is `null`, meaning the subtree is empty, it returns `null`.
    
    - If the current depth is one less than the target depth (`currdepth == depth - 1`), it means the current level is just above the target level. In this case, it duplicates the current level by adding new nodes with the specified value as children of each existing node, preserving the existing structure. Then, it returns the modified root.

    - If none of the above conditions are met, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, incrementing the current depth.

2. **`addOneRow` method**: This is the public method that acts as an interface to add a new row of nodes to the binary tree.

    - It simply calls the `helper` method with the provided parameters, starting the recursion from the root node.

3. **Return Value**: The `addOneRow` method returns the root of the modified binary tree after adding the new row.

Overall, the code efficiently adds a new row of nodes with the specified value to a binary tree at the specified depth using recursion.
