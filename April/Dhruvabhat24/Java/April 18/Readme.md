### Explanation of the Code

This Java code defines a `Solution` class with a method `islandPerimeter` that calculates the perimeter of a group of islands represented by a binary matrix grid.

1. **`islandPerimeter` method**: This method iterates through each cell of the grid to count the number of islands and their neighboring sides.

    - It initializes two variables: `islands` to count the number of islands and `neighbors` to count the number of neighboring sides between adjacent islands.
    
    - It iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
    
    - For each cell:
        - If the cell contains an island (`grid[i][j] == 1`), it increments the `islands` count.
        
        - It checks the neighboring cells to the left and top (if they exist). If neighboring cells contain islands (`grid[i - 1][j] == 1` or `grid[i][j - 1] == 1`), it increments the `neighbors` count.
    
    - After iterating through all cells, it calculates the perimeter using the formula: `perimeter = islands * 4 - neighbors * 2`. 
        - The number of sides of each island is 4 (top, bottom, left, right).
        - The number of sides shared between adjacent islands is counted twice, hence subtracting `neighbors * 2`.

    - Finally, it returns the calculated perimeter.

3. **Return Value**: The `islandPerimeter` method returns the perimeter of the group of islands represented by the binary matrix grid.

Overall, the code efficiently calculates the perimeter of a group of islands by counting the number of islands and their neighboring sides in the binary matrix grid.
