# Approach
The method analyzes the binary tree using a recursive depth-first traversal strategy. In order to generate an array that holds the previous value encountered at each level, it first counts the levels of the tree. After that, it iteratively explores the tree while concurrently determining if the node in question complies with the even-odd property. According to this feature, each node's value must differ by at least one unit from that of its parent node. Nodes at odd levels must have increasing values, and nodes at even levels must have decreasing values. The function returns false, indicating that the tree is not an even-odd tree, if any node deviates from these requirements. Alternatively, the method returns true, indicating that the tree fulfills the even-odd property at every level, if the traverse is completed without any violations. This method is dependable for figuring out whether a binary tree is an even-odd tree since it guarantees a quick assessment of the tree's values and structure.
