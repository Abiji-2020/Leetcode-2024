# Approach
Judge trusts nobody and he is trusted by all other person. If there are n person then , judge would be trusted by n-1 person. Considering this we need to find the person who is trusted by n-1 person and he himself do not trust annybody.


## Complexity
Time complexity: O(n+trustSize)O(n + trustSize)O(n+trustSize)
Space complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)
