# Approach
The problem requires finding the room where the maximum number of meetings can be accommodated, considering that some meetings can be delayed. Here's the intuition and approach for the given solution:

## Data Structures:

Two main data structures are used: endtime and count.
endtime: This vector keeps track of the end times of the meetings in each room. Initialized with zeros, it is updated as meetings are scheduled.
count: This vector keeps track of the count of meetings scheduled in each room.
Sorting Meetings:

Meetings are sorted based on their start times. This sorting ensures that meetings are processed in chronological order.
Processing Meetings:

Iterate through each meeting.
For each meeting, check if there's a room available immediately (endtime[j] <= start). If available, assign the meeting to that room and update its end time and count.
If no room is immediately available, find the room with the earliest available time (mindelay). Update its end time and count accordingly.
