# Approach
This approach uses the formula to calculate the sum of the first n numbers (n*(n+1)/2), then subtracts the sum of the array from it. The result is the missing number.

Find the sum of the first n numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2.
Find the sum of the array.
Subtract the sum of the array from the sum of the first n numbers.

# Complexity
### Time Complexity: O(n) - for summing up the array.
### Space Complexity: O(1)
