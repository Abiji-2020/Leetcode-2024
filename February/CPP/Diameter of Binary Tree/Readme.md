## Class: Solution

This class provides a method `diameterOfBinaryTree` to calculate the diameter of a binary tree.

### Helper Function: `cdanda`

This helper function recursively calculates the depth and diameter of a binary tree rooted at the given node.

#### Parameters

- `root`: A pointer to the root node of the binary tree.

#### Returns

A pair containing the diameter and height of the binary tree rooted at the given node.

### Method: `diameterOfBinaryTree`

Calculates the diameter of the binary tree.

#### Parameters

- `root`: A pointer to the root node of the binary tree.

#### Returns

An integer representing the diameter of the binary tree.

The approach efficiently calculates the diameter of the binary tree by recursively finding the depth and diameter of each subtree and updating the maximum diameter encountered.
