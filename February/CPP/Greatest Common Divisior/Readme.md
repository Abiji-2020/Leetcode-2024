# Can Traverse All Pairs

## Class: Solution

This class contains a method `canTraverseAllPairs()` to determine if it's possible to traverse all pairs of elements in an array `nums` following certain rules.

### Method: `canTraverseAllPairs`

Determines whether it's possible to traverse all pairs of elements in the array `nums` following certain rules.

#### Parameters

- `nums`: A vector of integers representing the input array.

#### Returns

A boolean value indicating whether it's possible to traverse all pairs of elements in `nums` following certain rules.

### Approach

The `canTraverseAllPairs()` method uses depth-first search (DFS) to determine whether it's possible to traverse all pairs of elements in the array `nums` following certain rules.

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - For each element in the input array `nums`, factorize it into prime factors and store the mapping between prime factors and their corresponding indices in `prime2index` and `index2prime` maps.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Perform DFS starting from index 0 to traverse through the array.
   - Mark visited indices and prime factors to avoid revisiting them during the traversal.
   - Explore the neighbors of each index based on the prime factors associated with the element at that index.
   - Recursively traverse the array until all reachable indices are visited.

3. **Check Traversal:**
   - After DFS, check if all indices in the array are visited. If any index is not visited, return `false`.
   - If all indices are visited, return `true`.

The approach efficiently determines whether it's possible to traverse all pairs of elements in the array `nums` following certain rules using DFS with a time complexity of O(N * log(M)), where N is the size of `nums` and M is the maximum value in `nums`.
