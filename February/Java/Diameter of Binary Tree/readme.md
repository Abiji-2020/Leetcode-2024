## Explanation of `diameterOfBinaryTree` in Markdown

**Class Name:**

* `Solution`

**Method:**

* `public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root)`:
    - Takes the root node of a binary tree as input.
    - Returns the diameter of the tree, which is the longest path between any two nodes.

**Logic:**

**1. Recursive Height Calculation:**

   - **`static int max = 0;`**: Declares a static variable `max` to store the maximum diameter encountered so far (avoid static variable for better practice).

   - **`int height(TreeNode root) { ... }`**: Defines a helper function `height` that takes a `TreeNode` and calculates its height:
     - **Base Case:** If `root` is null, its height is 0.
     - **Recursive Calls:** Calculate heights (`left` and `right`) of left and right subtrees recursively.
     - **Update Max:** Update `max` with the longest path found so far (`left + right`).
     - **Return Height:** Return the height of the current node (1 + max of left and right subtrees).

**2. Main Function:**

   - **`int max = 0;`**: Initialize `max` to 0.
   - **`height(root);`**: Call `height` on the root node to trigger the recursive calculation and update `max`.
   - **`return max;`**: Return the final value of `max`, representing the diameter of the tree.

**Key Points:**

- Uses recursion to traverse the tree and calculate node heights.
- Employs `max` to track the maximum path length found during traversal.
- Diameter is the longest path (sum of left and right subtree heights for a specific node).

**Assumptions:**

- Binary tree uses the `TreeNode` class with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.
- Tree can be empty or have any valid binary tree structure.

**Note:** Consider alternative approaches to managing the maximum diameter within the function's scope for better code practice (avoiding static variables).
