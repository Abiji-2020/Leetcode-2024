## Explanation of `isEvenOddTree` in Markdown:

**Class:** `Solution`

**Method:** `public boolean isEvenOddTree(TreeNode root)`

**Purpose:** Checks if a binary tree is an "even-odd tree."

**Logic:**

1. **Level-Order Traversal and Even-Odd Checks:**
   - **`levelOrderTraversal(root)`**: Performs a level-order traversal (not shown) and returns a list of lists (`levels`), where each inner list (`level`) represents nodes at a specific level.
   - Iterates through `levels`:
     - For each level `level` at index `i`:
       - Check the first element (`level.get(0)`):
         - If `i` is even (even levels): The first element must be **odd**.
         - If `i` is odd (odd levels): The first element must be **even**.
         - If the first element doesn't match the expected parity, return `false`.
       - Iterate through remaining elements (except the last) in the current level:
         - If consecutive elements have the same parity (both even or both odd) **or** are not in strictly **increasing order**, return `false`.

2. **Return Result:**
   - If all levels pass the parity and order checks, return `true`. The tree is an even-odd tree.

**Assumptions:**

- The binary tree is represented using the `TreeNode` class with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.
- The tree may be empty or have any valid binary tree structure.

**Key Points:**

- Combines level-order traversal and even-odd checks for efficiency.
- Verifies both parity and increasing order within each level.

**Note:** Consider replacing the use of `levelOrderTraversal` with an in-place solution to avoid creating the entire list of levels, potentially improving efficiency for larger trees.
