**Class Name:**

* `Solution`

**Method:**

* `public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q)`:
    * Takes two binary tree nodes, `p` and `q`, as input.
    * Returns `true` if the trees rooted at `p` and `q` are identical, and `false` otherwise.

**Logic:**

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If both `p` and `q` are null, they are considered identical and the function returns `true`.
   - If either `p` or `q` is null but the other is not, the trees are not identical and the function returns `false`.

2. **Value Comparison:**
   - If the values of `p` and `q` are not equal, the trees are not identical and the function returns `false`.

3. **Recursive Checks:**
   - The function calls itself recursively to compare the left subtrees of `p` and `q` using `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)`.
   - It then calls itself recursively to compare the right subtrees of `p` and `q` using `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If both recursive calls return `true` (meaning both subtrees are identical), the function returns `true`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `false`.

**Key Points:**

- The function uses a recursive approach to compare the structures and values of two binary trees.
- The base cases handle empty trees and trees with different structures.
- The function checks the values of the root nodes and then recursively compares the left and right subtrees.

**Assumptions:**

- The binary trees are represented using the `TreeNode` class, which has a value and left and right child pointers.
- The trees may be empty or have any valid binary tree structure.

I hope this explanation is helpful!
