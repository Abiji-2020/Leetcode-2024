# Binary Tree Diameter

The given Python code defines a `Solution` class with a method `diameterOfBinaryTree`, which calculates the diameter of a binary tree. The binary tree is represented using a `TreeNode` class.

## Code Explanation

1. The method takes a `root` node of the binary tree as an argument and returns an integer representing the diameter.
2. The code initializes a list `res` with a single element, initially set to 0. This list is used to store the maximum diameter during the traversal.
3. The code defines a helper function `dfs` (depth-first search) that recursively traverses the binary tree.
4. In the `dfs` function:
   - If the current node is `None`, it returns -1.
   - It recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - The maximum diameter passing through the current node is calculated and updated in the `res` list.
   - The depth of the current node is returned.
5. The `dfs` function is called with the root of the binary tree.
6. The final result is the value stored in the `res` list, representing the maximum diameter of the binary tree.

This code efficiently computes the diameter of the binary tree using a recursive depth-first search approach, keeping track of the maximum diameter during the traversal.
