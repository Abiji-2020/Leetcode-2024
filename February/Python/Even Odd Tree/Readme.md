# Even-Odd Tree 

The code defines a `Solution` class with a method `isEvenOddTree` that checks whether a given binary tree is an "even-odd" tree. In an even-odd tree, the levels of the tree alternate between even and odd values, and within each level, nodes must satisfy specific conditions:

- For even levels, all nodes must have strictly increasing values, and the values must be odd.
- For odd levels, all nodes must have strictly decreasing values, and the values must be even.

The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue (`q`). It iterates through the tree level by level, checking and updating conditions for each node. If any node violates the conditions, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` if the entire tree satisfies the even-odd criteria.

The `prev` variable is used to keep track of the previous node's value in the current level, ensuring the ordering conditions are met. The `even` variable is toggled after processing each level to switch between even and odd levels.
