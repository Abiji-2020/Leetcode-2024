# Check If It Is Possible to Traverse All Pairs
#Greatest Common Divisor Traversal

The given Python code defines a class `UnionFind` that implements a Union-Find data structure. Additionally, it defines a class `Solution` with a method `canTraverseAllPairs` that checks if it is possible to traverse all pairs in a given list of integers.

## Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Class:

- `__init__(self, n)`: Initializes the Union-Find data structure with `n` elements, each initially in its own set.
- `find(self, x)`: Finds the representative (parent) of the set to which `x` belongs, with path compression for optimization.
- `union(self, x, y)`: Unions the sets to which `x` and `y` belong, with union by rank for optimization.

## `canTraverseAllPairs` Method:

1. Create an instance of the Union-Find data structure (`uf`) with the length of the input list `nums`.
2. Create a dictionary (`factor_index`) to store the indices of prime factors encountered during the iteration through the elements of `nums`.
3. Iterate through the elements of `nums` and factorize each element, merging the indices of elements sharing common prime factors using the Union-Find data structure.
4. If the Union-Find data structure has only one set after the iteration, return `True`, indicating that it is possible to traverse all pairs. Otherwise, return `False`.

## Result:
The code efficiently utilizes Union-Find to track and merge sets based on common prime factors, enabling the determination of whether it is possible to traverse all pairs in the given list of integers. The factorization process and union operations ensure an optimal solution for this specific traversal constraint.
