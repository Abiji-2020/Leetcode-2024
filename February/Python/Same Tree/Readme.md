# Check if Two Binary Trees are the Same

The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isSameTree` that checks if two binary trees are identical.

## Approach:

The method uses a recursive approach to traverse the trees and compare corresponding nodes:

1. If both `p` and `q` are `None`, return `True` as the trees are identical.
2. If only one of `p` or `q` is `None`, or their values are not equal, return `False`.
3. Recursively call `isSameTree` for the left and right subtrees of `p` and `q`.
4. Return the logical AND of the results of the recursive calls.

## Result:

The code efficiently determines whether two binary trees, rooted at `p` and `q`, are the same by recursively comparing corresponding nodes. The base cases handle situations where both nodes are `None` or have different values, and the recursive calls ensure a thorough comparison of the entire tree structure. This approach provides a straightforward solution for checking the equality of two binary trees.
