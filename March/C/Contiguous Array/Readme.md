# Approach
<br> 1. Initialize variables and an array to track sums.
<br> 2. Iterate through the array, updating the sum and checking for previously encountered sums.
<br> 3. Calculate the length of subarrays with equal numbers of 0s and 1s.
<br> 4. Update the maximum length encountered so far.
<br> 5. Return the maximum length found.
