1. Define a comparison function (compare):

* The compare function is a callback function for the qsort function, which compares two integers.
* It takes two const void* arguments (pointers to void, which allows it to accept any type of data).
* It casts these pointers to int* and dereferences them to get the integers they point to.
* It subtracts one integer from the other, which effectively sorts the array in ascending order.
2. Sort the array (qsort):

* The qsort function sorts the array nums using the comparison function compare.
* It takes the array (nums), the size of the array (numsSize), the size of each element (sizeof(int)), and the comparison function (compare).
3. Iterate through the sorted array:

* A loop iterates from index 0 to numsSize - 2. It stops at numsSize - 2 because the last element is already checked against the second to last element.
* Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (nums[i]) is equal to the next element (nums[i + 1]).
4. If a duplicate is found, it returns the duplicate number (nums[i]).
5. Return -1 if no duplicate is found:

* If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns -1, indicating that no duplicate was found.
