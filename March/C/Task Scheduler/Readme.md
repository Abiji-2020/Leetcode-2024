# Intuition

1. Frequency Counting: Count the frequency of each task in the input array.
2. Finding Maximum Frequency: Identify the task with the highest frequency among all tasks.
3. Counting Tasks with Maximum Frequency: Count how many tasks share the highest frequency.
4. Calculating Minimum Intervals:

* Determine the intervals needed for the most frequent task to complete all but one of its occurrences.
* Account for spacing out tasks with the same maximum frequency.
* Calculate the minimum intervals required based on the given formula.

5. Handling Edge Cases: If the calculated intervals are insufficient for all tasks, return the length of the tasks array.
6. Returning Result: Return the minimum intervals required to execute all tasks.
