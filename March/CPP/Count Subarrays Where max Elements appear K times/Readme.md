# Intuition
To count the number of subarrays with at least k elements that contain the maximum element in the array, we can use a sliding window approach. We maintain a window that expands when the current element is not the maximum and contracts when the current element is the maximum. We update the count of subarrays whenever the window size increases.

# Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers, left and right, both pointing to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `count` to track the number of occurrences of the maximum element in the current window.
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to store the count of subarrays satisfying the condition.
   - Iterate through the array with pointer right:
     - Expand the window by moving right to the right until the current element is the maximum.
     - Update the count of occurrences of the maximum element whenever the window size increases.
     - Shrink the window by moving left to the right until the count of occurrences of the maximum element is less than k.
     - Update the answer by adding the number of subarrays possible with the maximum element being the last element of the window.
   - Continue this process until the end of the array is reached.
   - Return the total count of subarrays satisfying the condition.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
  - Both pointers traverse the array once, and each element is processed at most twice.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space.
