# Intuition
The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer that does not exist in the given array. We can achieve this by rearranging the elements of the array such that each positive integer i (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n) is at the (i - 1)th index. Then, we can iterate through the array to find the first index i where nums[i] ≠ i + 1, indicating the absence of the smallest positive integer i + 1.

# Approach
1. **Rearranging the Array**:
   - Iterate through the array and for each element nums[i], swap it with nums[nums[i] - 1] until it reaches the correct position or becomes out of range.
   - Ensure that the current element is within the range [1, n] and not already at its correct position to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Finding the First Missing Positive Integer**:
   - Traverse the array and check if nums[i] ≠ i + 1. If found, return i + 1 as the first missing positive integer.
   - If all elements are in their correct positions, return n + 1 as the first missing positive integer.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
  - The algorithm performs a linear scan through the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
  - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
