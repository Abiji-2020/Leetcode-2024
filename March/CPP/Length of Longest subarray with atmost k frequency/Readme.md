# Intuition
To find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k, we can use a sliding window approach. We maintain a window that expands when the current sum is less than k and contracts when the current sum exceeds k. We update the maximum subarray length whenever the window size increases.

# Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers, i and j, both pointing to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a hash map to store the frequency of elements in the current window.
   - Iterate through the array with pointer j:
     - Expand the window by moving j to the right until the sum of elements in the window is less than k.
     - Update the maximum subarray length whenever the window size increases.
     - Shrink the window by moving i to the right until the sum of elements in the window is greater than or equal to k.
   - Continue this process until the end of the array is reached.
   - Return the maximum subarray length found.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
  - Both pointers traverse the array once, and each element is processed at most twice.
- Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case.
  - We use a hash map to store the frequency of elements in the current window, which could contain all elements of the array.
