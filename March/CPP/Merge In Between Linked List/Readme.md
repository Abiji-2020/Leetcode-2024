# Intuition
The problem requires merging a second linked list (`list2`) into the first linked list (`list1`) between the ath and bth nodes of `list1`. To accomplish this, we need to perform the following steps:
- Traverse `list1` to find the ath and bth nodes.
- Traverse `list2` to find its last node.
- Connect the last node of `list2` to the node after the ath node in `list1`.
- Connect the node before the bth node of `list1` to the first node of `list2`.
- Return `list1` with `list2` merged in between the ath and bth nodes.

# Approach
1. Initialize a temporary pointer `temp` to `list1`.
2. Traverse `list1` until reaching the ath node.
3. Store the node after the ath node as `removing`.
4. Traverse `list1` starting from the ath node until reaching the bth node. Update `removing` to point to the node after the bth node.
5. Connect the last node of `list2` to the node after the ath node in `list1`.
6. Traverse `list2` until reaching its last node.
7. Connect the last node of `list2` to the node after the bth node in `list1`.
8. Return `list1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - Traversing `list1` to find the ath and bth nodes: O(b), where b is the index of the bth node in `list1`.
  - Traversing `list2` to find its last node: O(length of list2).
  - Overall time complexity: O(b + length of list2).

- Space complexity:
  - Constant extra space is used, so the space complexity is O(1).
