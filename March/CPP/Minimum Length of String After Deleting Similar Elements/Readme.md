## Class: Solution

This class contains a method `minimumLength()` to find the minimum possible length of a non-empty string `s` after removing one character.

### Method: `minimumLength`

Finds the minimum possible length of a non-empty string `s` after removing one character.

#### Parameters

- `s`: A string representing the input string.

#### Returns

- An integer representing the minimum possible length of `s` after removing one character.

#### Approach

1. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Initialize two pointers `front` and `end` pointing to the start and end of the string `s`, respectively.
   - Iterate over the string from both ends, comparing characters at `front` and `end`.
   - If the characters at `front` and `end` are equal, increment `front` and decrement `end` until the characters change.
   - Once the characters at `front` and `end` are different or `front` becomes greater than or equal to `end`, stop the iteration.

2. **Result Calculation:**
   - Calculate the minimum length of the resulting string by subtracting the index of `front` from the index of `end` and adding 1 (to account for zero-based indexing).

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This complexity arises from traversing the string once with two pointers.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this method is O(1). It uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables and does not depend on the size of the input string.
