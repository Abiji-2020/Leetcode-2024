# Intuition
To determine if a linked list is a palindrome, we can utilize the concept of reversing the second half of the list and then comparing it with the first half. By using two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other (to find the middle of the list), we can achieve this in linear time.

# Approach
1. **Middle Finding with Two Pointers**:
   - Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
   - Move slow pointer one step at a time and fast pointer two steps at a time until fast reaches the end of the list or the last node before the end.
   - While traversing, reverse the first half of the list using the prev pointer to keep track of the previous node.
   - When fast reaches the end or the last node before the end, slow will be at the middle of the list.

2. **Palindrome Checking**:
   - If the length of the list is odd, move slow one step forward.
   - Compare the first half (reversed) with the second half (starting from slow).
   - If any of the values differ, return false immediately; otherwise, continue comparing until the end of the list.

3. **Reversing the First Half**:
   - During the traversal of the first half, reverse the pointers to create a reverse order of the nodes.
   - Maintain a prev pointer to store the previous node while iterating.

4. **Checking for Palindrome**:
   - After finding the middle, adjust slow pointer if needed (for odd-length lists).
   - Compare values of nodes starting from slow with the nodes in the reversed first half (tracked by prev).
   - If any value differs, return false; otherwise, continue until reaching the end of the list.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once to find the middle and then compare the values of nodes in the first and second halves.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.
