**Explanation of `bagOfTokensScore` in Markdown:**

**Class:** `Solution`

**Method:** `public int bagOfTokensScore(int[] tokens, int power)`

**Purpose:** Calculates the maximum score achievable using the given tokens for a specific power level.

**Logic:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - **`Arrays.sort(tokens);`**: Sorts the `tokens` array in ascending order. This is crucial for efficiently utilizing lower-valued tokens first.
   - **`int left = 0, right = tokens.length - 1;`**: Initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to iterate through the sorted `tokens` array from both ends.
   - **`int score = 0, maxScore = 0;`**: Initializes variables to track the current score (`score`) and the maximum score achieved so far (`maxScore`).

2. **Iterative Processing:**
   - **`while(left <= right)`**: Continues the loop as long as `left` and `right` pointers haven't crossed each other (elements remain to be processed).
     - **`if(tokens[left] <= power)`**: Checks if the current token at index `left` is affordable (less than or equal to the current `power` level):
       - **`power -= tokens[left++];`**: Deducts the token's value from the `power` level and increments `left` to move to the next token.
       - **`score++;`**: Increases the `score` by 1 as a token is used successfully.
       - **`maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score);`**: Updates `maxScore` if the current `score` is higher than the previously recorded maximum.
     - **`else if(score > 0)`**: If the current token is too expensive but there are points accumulated (`score > 0`):
       - **`power += tokens[right--];`**: Exchanges a high-value token from the end (`right`) to gain enough power. Decrements `right` to move to the previous token.
       - **`score--;`**: Decrements the `score` by 1 as a point is spent for the exchange.
     - **`else`**: If neither condition is met (cannot afford the current token and no points to exchange), the loop terminates as further attempts would be futile.

3. **Return Result:**
   - **`return maxScore;`**: Returns the `maxScore` achieved during the processing, representing the maximum number of tokens used successfully.

**Key Points:**

- Employs a two-pointer approach and sorting to strategically use tokens based on affordability.
- Prioritizes using lower-valued tokens first by sorting the array in ascending order.
- Allows exchanging a high-value token for power only if points have been accumulated (`score > 0`).

**Assumptions:**

- The `tokens` array contains only positive integers.
- The initial `power` level is also a positive integer.

**Time Complexity:**

- O(n log n) due to the sorting of the `tokens` array.

**Space Complexity:**

- O(1) as it uses constant extra space for the pointers and variables.
