1. `public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {`: Declares a method named `findMaxLength` that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer. It aims to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
2. `int len = nums.length;`: Calculates the length of the input array `nums` and stores it in the variable `len` for iteration and array initialization.
3. `int sum = 0;`: Initializes a variable `sum` to track the running sum of 0s and 1s encountered in `nums`. 0s decrement `sum`, and 1s increment `sum`.
4. `int[] arr = new int[len+1];`: Initializes an integer array `arr` of size `len + 1` to store running sum values encountered while iterating through `nums`.
5. `for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){`: Initiates a loop iterating over each element of the input array `nums`.
6. `if(nums[i] == 0)`: Checks if the current element in `nums` is 0.
7. `sum--;`: Decrements `sum` if the current element is 0.
8. `else`: Executes if the current element in `nums` is not 0 (i.e., it's 1).
9. `sum++;`: Increments `sum` if the current element is 1.
10. `arr[i+1] = sum;`: Assigns the current value of `sum` to `arr` at index `i+1` to store the running sum.
11. `int max = 0;`: Initializes `max` to store the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
12. `Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`: Initializes a HashMap named `map` to store running sum along with its index.
13. `for (int i = 0; i < len + 1; i++){`: Initiates a loop iterating over each index of the `arr` array.
14. `if(map.containsKey(arr[i]))`: Checks if the current running sum `arr[i]` is already in `map`.
15. `max = Math.max(max, i - map.get(arr[i]));`: Calculates the length of the current subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s and updates `max` if the current length is greater.
16. `else`: Executes if the current running sum has not been encountered before.
17. `map.put(arr[i], i);`: Stores the current running sum `arr[i]` with its index in `map`.
18. `return max;`: Returns the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
