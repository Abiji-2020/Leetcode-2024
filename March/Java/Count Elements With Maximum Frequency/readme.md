## Finding Elements with Maximum Frequency

**Class:** `Solution`

**Method:** `public int maxFrequencyElements(int[] nums)`

**Purpose:** Calculates the total count of elements in an array that appear the most frequently.

**Logic:**

1. **Frequency Map:**
   - **`int count = 0;`**: Initializes `count` to store the total count of elements with the maximum frequency.
   - **`Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();`**: Creates a hash map `frequencyMap` to track element frequencies. The key represents the element (integer), and the value stores its frequency (count of occurrences).

2. **Iterate and Update Frequencies:**
   - **`for (int num : nums)`**: Loops through each element `num` in the array.
     - **`frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);`**: Updates the frequency count for `num` in the `frequencyMap`:
       - Uses `getOrDefault` to retrieve the existing count (defaults to 0 if not encountered before).
       - Increments the count by 1 for the current element.
     - **`maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, frequencyMap.get(num));`**: Tracks the maximum frequency seen so far by comparing the current element's frequency with the existing `maxFreq`.

3. **Count Elements with Maximum Frequency:**
   - **`for (int freq : frequencyMap.values())`**: Iterates through all frequency values in the `frequencyMap`.
     - **`if (freq == maxFreq) count += freq;`**: Checks if the current frequency (`freq`) is equal to the `maxFreq`. If so, adds the current frequency count to the total `count`. This ensures we only count elements with the maximum frequency.

4. **Return Result:**
   - **`return count;`**: Returns the final `count` representing the total number of elements that appear the most frequently.

**Key Points:**

- Employs a hash map for efficient frequency tracking.
- Maintains the maximum frequency encountered during iteration.
- Calculates the total count considering only elements with the maximum frequency.

**Assumptions:**

- The `nums` array may contain any valid integers.

**Time Complexity:**

- O(n) in the average and best cases, where `n` is the number of elements, as the loop iterates through the array once.

**Space Complexity:**

- O(n) in the worst case, as the `frequencyMap` can potentially store all unique elements in the array.
