This Java code presents a solution to count the number of subarrays with at most k occurrences of the maximum element in the array nums. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `countSubarrays`:** The `countSubarrays` method calculates the number of subarrays with at most k occurrences of the maximum element in the array nums.

2. **Finding Maximum Element:** The code first finds the maximum element `mx` in the array nums using the `max()` method from the Arrays class. 

3. **Sliding Window Approach:** The method utilizes a sliding window approach with two pointers `l` and `r` to define the current subarray.

4. **Iterating Through the Array:** The code iterates through the array nums from left to right using the pointers `l` and `r`.

5. **Counting Occurrences of Maximum Element:** As the window slides from left to right, the code decrements the value of `k` if the element at the current position `r` is equal to the maximum element `mx`. 

6. **Updating Pointers:** When `k` becomes 0, indicating that the maximum occurrences of the maximum element have been reached, the code moves the left pointer `l` to the right until the condition is satisfied.

7. **Counting Subarrays:** During each iteration, the code increments the count `ans` by the value of the left pointer `l`, representing the number of subarrays ending at the current position `r` that meet the condition.

8. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire array nums, the method returns the total count `ans` of subarrays with at most k occurrences of the maximum element.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[2, 1, 3, 2, 2]` and `k = 2`.

- **Sliding Window Approach:**
    - The window starts with `[2]`. As it moves to the right, it becomes `[2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 3]`, `[1, 3, 2]`, `[3, 2, 2]`.
    - At each step, the code counts the number of subarrays meeting the condition and updates the count `ans`.
    - The total count of subarrays with at most 2 occurrences of the maximum element `2` is 7.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm counts the number of subarrays meeting the condition and demonstrates its execution with an example.
