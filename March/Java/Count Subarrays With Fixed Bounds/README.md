This Java code provides a solution to count the number of subarrays in an array A where the minimum element in the subarray is minK and the maximum element is maxK. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `countSubarrays`:** The `countSubarrays` method calculates the number of subarrays in the array A where the minimum element is minK and the maximum element is maxK.

2. **Initialization:** The method initializes variables `res`, `jbad`, `jmin`, and `jmax` to track the count of subarrays and the indices of the last occurrences of elements less than minK, equal to minK, and equal to maxK, respectively. The variable `n` represents the length of the array A.

3. **Iterating Through the Array:** The method iterates through the array A using the variable `i`.

4. **Updating Indices:** During each iteration, the method updates the indices `jbad`, `jmin`, and `jmax` based on the encountered elements. If the element A[i] is less than minK or greater than maxK, it updates `jbad`. If A[i] is equal to minK, it updates `jmin`, and if A[i] is equal to maxK, it updates `jmax`.

5. **Calculating Subarray Count:** The method calculates the number of subarrays meeting the condition by subtracting the index of the last occurrence of the element less than minK (stored in `jbad`) from the minimum of the indices of the last occurrences of elements equal to minK and maxK (stored in `jmin` and `jmax`). This value represents the count of subarrays ending at index `i` where the minimum element is minK and the maximum element is maxK. The maximum function is used to ensure that the calculated value is non-negative.

6. **Accumulating Result:** The calculated count is added to the variable `res` to accumulate the total count of subarrays meeting the condition.

7. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire array A, the method returns the final count `res` of subarrays where the minimum element is minK and the maximum element is maxK.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[3, 1, 4, 2, 1]` and `minK = 1`, `maxK = 3`.

- **Subarrays with Minimum 1 and Maximum 3:**
    - The method calculates the count of subarrays where the minimum element is 1 and the maximum element is 3.
    - The total count of such subarrays is 10.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm counts the number of subarrays meeting the condition and demonstrates its execution with an example.
