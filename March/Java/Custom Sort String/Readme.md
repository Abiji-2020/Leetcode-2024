1. **customSortString Method:**
   - The `customSortString` method takes two strings: `order` represents the custom order of characters, and `s` is the string to be sorted according to the custom order.

2. **Frequency Array Initialization:**
   - An array `arr` of size 26 (assuming lowercase English alphabets) is created to store the frequency of each character in `s`.

3. **Counting Character Frequencies:**
   - The first loop counts the frequency of each character in `s` and stores it in the `arr` array.

4. **Sorting According to Custom Order:**
   - The second loop iterates through each character in the custom order (`order`). For each character, it appends it to the sorted string `ans` as many times as its frequency in `s`.

5. **Appending Remaining Characters:**
   - The third loop appends any remaining characters from `s` that are not present in the custom order.

6. **Conversion and Return:**
   - Finally, the sorted string `ans` is converted to a string and returned.
