This Java code implements a solution to find duplicates in an array of integers. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `findDuplicates`:** The `findDuplicates` method takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of integers containing the duplicates found in the array.

2. **Data Structures Used:** The code utilizes a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each element in the array. Additionally, it uses a `Vector` to collect the duplicate elements found.

3. **Frequency Counting:** The code iterates through the array `nums`, and for each element encountered, it updates the frequency count in the `HashMap`. If the element is not present in the `HashMap`, it adds it with a frequency of 1. If the element already exists in the `HashMap`, its frequency is incremented.

4. **Finding Duplicates:** After counting the frequencies of all elements in the array, the code iterates through the keys of the `HashMap`. For each key (element), it checks if its frequency is greater than 1. If so, it adds the element to the `Vector`, indicating that it is a duplicate.

5. **Returning Result:** Finally, the `Vector` containing the duplicate elements is returned as the result.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`.

- **Frequency Counting:**
    - After iterating through the array, the `HashMap` contains: `{4: 1, 3: 2, 2: 2, 7: 1, 8: 1, 1: 1}`.

- **Finding Duplicates:**
    - The code identifies the keys with frequencies greater than 1, which are `3` and `2`. These are the duplicate elements found.

- **Return Value:**
    - The method returns a list containing the duplicate elements: `[3, 2]`.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm finds duplicates in the array and demonstrates its execution with an example.
