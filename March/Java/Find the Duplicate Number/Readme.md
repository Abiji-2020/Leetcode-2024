This Java code presents a solution to find a duplicate number in an array of integers. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `findDuplicate`:** The `findDuplicate` method iterates through the array and compares each pair of elements to find a duplicate. If a duplicate is found, it immediately returns the duplicate number.

2. **Nested Loop Iteration:** The code employs a nested loop structure to compare each element of the array with every other element. The outer loop iterates over each element from the beginning to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates over the subsequent elements from the current element's position to the end of the array.

3. **Duplicate Detection:** For each pair of elements compared, if two elements are found to be equal, indicating a duplicate, the method immediately returns the duplicate number found. This ensures that the method exits early upon finding the first duplicate encountered in the array.

4. **Return Value:** If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire array, the method returns -1 to signify the absence of a duplicate.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`.

- **Iteration:**
    - The method compares each pair of elements to find a duplicate. It checks `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(4, 2)` but does not find any duplicates.
    - However, when comparing `(1, 2)`, it identifies a duplicate, as both elements are equal. Therefore, the method returns `2`, which is the duplicate number found.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm finds a duplicate number in the array and demonstrates its execution with an example.
