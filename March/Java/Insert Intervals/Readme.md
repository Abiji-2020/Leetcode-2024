This Java code defines a class `Solution` with a method `insert` that takes two parameters: a 2D array of intervals `intervals` and a 1D array `newInterval`. The goal of this method is to insert the `newInterval` into the list of intervals while merging overlapping intervals.

1. **Converting to List:** The code first converts the `intervals` array into a list of integer arrays for easier manipulation using `ArrayList`.

2. **Adding New Interval:** The `newInterval` is added to the list of intervals.

3. **Sorting:** The list of intervals is then sorted based on the end points of each interval using a lambda comparator. This step is crucial for merging intervals efficiently in the subsequent steps.

4. **Merging Intervals:** The code initializes a list `res` to store the merged intervals. It starts by adding the first interval from the sorted list to `res`.

5. **Iterating Through Intervals:** The code iterates through the sorted list of intervals starting from the second interval. For each interval, it compares the start and end points with the last interval in `res`. If there is an overlap, it merges the intervals by updating the start and end points accordingly and removes the last interval from `res`. This process continues until no overlap is found.

6. **Returning Result:** Finally, the merged intervals are converted back to a 2D array and returned as the result.
