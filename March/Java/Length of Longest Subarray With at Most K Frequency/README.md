This Java code presents a solution to find the maximum length of a subarray with at most k distinct elements in an array nums. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `maxSubarrayLength`:** The `maxSubarrayLength` method calculates the maximum length of a subarray with at most k distinct elements.

2. **Map to Track Element Frequencies:** The code utilizes a HashMap `map` to track the frequencies of elements encountered in the current subarray. Each entry in the map represents an element and its frequency.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:** The method employs a sliding window approach to iterate through the array nums. It maintains two pointers i and j to define the current subarray.

4. **Updating Map and Sliding Window:** As the window slides from left to right, the code updates the map to reflect the frequencies of elements within the window. It also adjusts the window by incrementing i if the number of distinct elements exceeds k, ensuring that the window contains at most k distinct elements.

5. **Calculating Maximum Length:** During each iteration, the code calculates the length of the current subarray (j - i + 1) and updates the maximum length `ans` accordingly.

6. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire array nums, the method returns the maximum length `ans`.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` and `k = 2`.

- **Sliding Window Approach:**
    - The window starts with `[1]`. As it moves to the right, it becomes `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, `[1, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 3]`.
    - At each step, the code updates the map and calculates the length of the subarray, tracking the maximum length encountered.
    - The maximum length of a subarray with at most 2 distinct elements is 4.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm calculates the maximum length of a subarray with at most k distinct elements and demonstrates its execution with an example.
