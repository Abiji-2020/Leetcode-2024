The `productExceptSelf` method calculates the product of all elements in the input array `nums` except for the element itself. It does so by first initializing an array `right` to store the product of elements to the right of each element in `nums`. It starts by traversing `nums` from right to left, multiplying each element encountered with the previous product and storing the result in the `right` array. This process ensures that `right[j]` contains the product of all elements to the right of `nums[j]`.

After computing the products to the right of each element, the method proceeds to calculate the final product for each element by multiplying the product of elements to the left and right of it. It iterates through `nums` once again, this time from left to right. For each element at index `k`, it calculates the product of elements to the left (up to `k-1`) and to the right (starting from `k+1`). These left and right products are then multiplied together to obtain the final product for the current element, which is stored in the `right` array.

Finally, the method returns the `right` array containing the products of all elements except themselves. Each element `right[i]` represents the product of all elements in the original array `nums`, excluding `nums[i]`. By computing the products to the left and right of each element and multiplying them together, the method efficiently computes the desired result without using division.
