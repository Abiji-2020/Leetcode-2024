This Java code presents a solution to find the number of contiguous subarrays in an array `nums` whose product is less than a given integer `k`. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `numSubarrayProductLessThanK`:** The `numSubarrayProductLessThanK` method calculates the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the given integer `k`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:** The method checks if `k` is equal to 0. If `k` is 0, it returns 0, as no subarray can have a product less than 0.

3. **Counting Subarrays:** The method iterates through the array `nums` using two nested loops to consider all possible subarrays. The outer loop iterates from the start of the array to its end, and the inner loop iterates from the current index to the end of the array.

4. **Product Calculation:** Within the nested loops, the code calculates the product of each subarray. It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and multiplies it by each element of the subarray. If the product is less than `k`, it increments the `count` to track the number of subarrays with a product less than `k`. If the product becomes greater than or equal to `k`, the inner loop breaks, as continuing would result in a product greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Returning Result:** After iterating through all possible subarrays, the method returns the final count of subarrays whose product is less than `k`.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[10, 5, 2, 6]` and `k = 100`.

- **Subarray Products Less Than 100:**
    - The subarrays with product less than 100 are: `[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [10, 5, 2], [5, 2, 6]`.
    - Therefore, the method returns `9`, indicating that there are 9 subarrays with product less than 100.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm calculates the number of contiguous subarrays with a product less than the given integer `k` and demonstrates its execution with an example.
