This Java code provides a solution to count the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements in an array nums. Let's explore the functionality of the code along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Method Implementation - `subarraysWithKDistinct`:** The `subarraysWithKDistinct` method calculates the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements by subtracting the count of subarrays with at most (k - 1) distinct elements from the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.

2. **Helper Method - `atmostK`:** The `atmostK` method calculates the number of subarrays with at most k distinct elements. It employs a sliding window approach to iterate through the array nums while maintaining a HashMap to track the frequencies of elements within the current window.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:** The method utilizes two pointers `i` and `j` to define the current subarray. The right pointer `j` moves from left to right, adding elements to the HashMap and expanding the window. The left pointer `i` moves to the right when the number of distinct elements in the window exceeds k, contracting the window.

4. **Counting Subarrays:** During each iteration, the method calculates the number of subarrays with at most k distinct elements ending at the current position `j` by subtracting the left pointer `i` from the right pointer `j` and adding 1. This count is accumulated in the variable `ans`.

5. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire array nums, the method returns the total count `ans` of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.

Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Suppose we have an array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` and `k = 2`.

- **Subarrays with Exactly 2 Distinct Elements:**
    - The method calculates the count of subarrays with at most 2 distinct elements and subtracts the count of subarrays with at most 1 distinct element from it to obtain the count of subarrays with exactly 2 distinct elements.
    - The total count of subarrays with exactly 2 distinct elements is 7.

This detailed explanation provides insights into how the algorithm counts the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements and demonstrates its execution with an example.
