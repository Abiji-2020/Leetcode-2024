## Max Frequency Elements

The `Solution` class defines a method `maxFrequencyElements` that takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns the count of elements with the maximum frequency in the given list.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Counter Generation:**
   - The code uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to create a dictionary-like object that counts the occurrences of each element in the input list `nums`.

2. **Maximum Frequency Determination:**
   - It calculates the maximum frequency (`max_frq`) by finding the maximum value among the counts obtained from the Counter.

3. **Counting Elements with Max Frequency:**
   - It then returns the sum of counts for all elements that have the maximum frequency in the original list.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.maxFrequencyElements(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 3 (as 3 is the element with the maximum frequency)
