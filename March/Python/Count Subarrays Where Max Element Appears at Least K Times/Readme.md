This Python code defines a class Solution with a method countSubarrays that takes in a list of integers nums and an integer k. The goal of the method is to count the number of subarrays in nums that contain exactly k occurrences of the maximum value in nums.

The code initializes variables max_n to the maximum value in nums and max_cnt to 0. It also initializes variables l and res to 0.

It iterates through the elements of nums using a sliding window approach with pointers l and r. It increments max_cnt each time it encounters the maximum value in nums.

Within the while loop, it checks if max_cnt equals k. If so, it enters another while loop where it decrements max_cnt as long as nums[l] equals max_n, and increments l. It then adds the current value of l to the result res.

Finally, it returns the result res, which represents the count of subarrays with exactly k occurrences of the maximum value in nums.
