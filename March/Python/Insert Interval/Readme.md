### Insert Interval

The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `insert` designed to insert a new interval into a list of intervals while maintaining the sorted order of intervals.

### Method Description:

- **`insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]`:**
  - This method takes two parameters: `intervals`, a list of intervals represented as lists of two integers, and `newInterval`, a list representing the new interval to be inserted.
  - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the resulting intervals after insertion.
  - It iterates through each interval in the `intervals` list.
  - Inside the loop:
    - If the end of the `newInterval` is before the start of the current interval, it means that `newInterval` comes before the current interval. In this case, it appends `newInterval` to the result list and then appends the remaining intervals from the original list and returns the result.
    - If the start of the `newInterval` is after the end of the current interval, it means that `newInterval` comes after the current interval. In this case, it appends the current interval to the result list without any changes.
    - Otherwise, there is an overlap between `newInterval` and the current interval. It updates `newInterval` to merge both intervals by taking the minimum of their starts and the maximum of their ends.
  - Finally, it appends the modified `newInterval` to the result list, since it either didn't overlap with any existing interval or it was merged with one or more intervals.
  - It returns the resulting list of intervals.

### Conclusion:
The code effectively inserts the new interval into the list of intervals while ensuring the intervals remain sorted and merged appropriately.
